## ‚ö†Ô∏è Adding AD_ID permission for Android ‚ö†Ô∏è
In v6.8.0 of the AppsFlyer SDK, we added the normal permission `com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID` to the SDK's AndroidManifest, 
to allow the SDK to collect the Android Advertising ID on apps targeting API 33.
If your app is targeting children, you need to revoke this permission to comply with Google's Data policy.
You can read more about it [here](https://dev.appsflyer.com/hc/docs/install-android-sdk#the-ad_id-permission).
